    "**Scope and goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the B92 QKD protocol and compares between various Error Correction Schemes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantum stage (B92):** generation, transmission, measurement and sifting of raw key using Qiskit simulation.  \n",
    "   - B92 uses *two non-orthogonal* states (canonical choice: $ |0\\rangle $ and $ |+\\rangle $.  \n",
    "   - Bob performs measurements that sometimes give *inconclusive results*. Only conclusive results remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Channel model and eavesdropper:** We model realistic noise (depolarising / bit-flip) and an optional intercept-resend eavesdropper to illustrate QBER.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classical post-processing:**\n",
    "   - **Error estimation** (QBER).\n",
    "   - **Error correction** with multiple algorithms:\n",
    "     - **Cascade** (interactive parity-based protocol).\n",
    "     - **Hamming (7,4)** (block code, single-error correction).\n",
    "     - **LDPC** — iterative belief-propagation decoder for an LDPC code.\n",
    "     - **Polar codes** — successive cancellation (SC) decoder demonstration.\n",
    "   - **Privacy amplification** using universal hashing (Toeplitz hash matrix) — modern approach to remove leaked information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparison metrics:**\n",
    "   - **Key rate** (final secure key bits / initial signals).\n",
    "   - **Residual error rate** (probability of mismatched final keys).\n",
    "   - **Leakage** (bits revealed over public channel during error correction).\n",
    "   - **Computation/time cost** (roughly measured).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Plots and tables** comparing performance vs channel QBER for each error-correction method.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bob's measurement strategy (canonical, projective approximation):** randomly choose to measure in the Z-basis or X-basis. If Bob measures in Z-basis and obtains outcome `1`, that outcome is *inconclusive* for distinguishing \\(|0\\rangle\\) vs \\(|+\\rangle\\); if Bob measures in Z and obtains `0`, that may be conclusive for rejecting \\(|1\\rangle` in some variants. We will implement the operational rules used in many textbooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If Bob measures in basis orthogonal to one of Alice's states and obtains the orthogonal outcome, he can conclude which state was **not** sent and hence infer a bit. Otherwise result is inconclusive and discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter definitions**\n",
    "- \\(N\\): number of transmitted quantum signals.  \n",
    "- QBER: quantum bit error rate measured on sifted key.  \n",
    "- Leakage \\(L\\): number of bits revealed in error-correction.  \n",
    "- Final key length after privacy amplification: \\( \\ell \\approx H_{\\min} - L - 2\\log(1/\\epsilon) \\) (conceptual). We'll use a simplified conservative bound based on observed QBER.\n",
